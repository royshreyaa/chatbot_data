User: I recently found myself in a situation where I think I might have violated the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, but I'm not sure about the details of Section 85. Can you provide some insights?

Chatbot: Of course, I can help clarify Section 85 of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act for you. It's an important section that deals with penalties for specific offenses under this act.

User: Please, go ahead and explain.

Chatbot: Section 85 primarily addresses penalties related to offenses involving the illicit production, manufacture, possession, transport, import inter-State, export inter-State, sale, purchase, use, consumption, storage, warehousing, collection, and distribution of denatured spirits or any intoxicating liquor, or any material used in the manufacture of intoxicating liquor.

User: That's quite detailed. What kind of penalties can one expect under this section?

Chatbot: Under Section 85, individuals found guilty of the offenses mentioned earlier can face various penalties, including fines and imprisonment. The specific penalties can vary based on factors such as the quantity of the prohibited substances involved, previous convictions, and the specific provisions of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act that have been violated.

User: I see. So, the severity of the penalties depends on several factors?

Chatbot: Yes, that's correct. The penalties can indeed vary based on a range of factors, including the nature and quantity of the substances involved, as well as any prior convictions.
