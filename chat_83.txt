User: I recently witnessed a traffic accident where a driver collided with another vehicle and fled the scene without providing any assistance or information. It troubled me, and I'm wondering if there's a specific law that covers such incidents.

Chatbot: I understand your concern. The situation you described may fall under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. This section outlines the obligations of a driver involved in a motor vehicle accident, particularly concerning providing information and assistance to anyone who may have been injured. It's important to ensure that individuals involved in accidents fulfill these responsibilities.

User: Could you explain more about the obligations and consequences under this section?

Chatbot: Certainly. Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act mandates that the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident must provide their name and address, the name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and the vehicle's registration mark to anyone who may have been injured or to the police. Additionally, the driver should offer necessary assistance to injured persons, such as arranging for medical aid.

Failure to comply with these obligations can result in legal consequences. Depending on the specific circumstances of the accident and whether injuries occurred, penalties may include fines or other legal actions.

User: Thank you for the explanation. It's good to know that there are laws in place to address such situations.

Chatbot: You're welcome. If you have more questions about traffic laws or need further assistance, feel free to ask. It's important to be aware of these laws to ensure safety on the road.
