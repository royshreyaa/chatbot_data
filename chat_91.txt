User: I'm currently facing a distressing situation related to ragging at my college. Some seniors have been harassing me, and it's becoming unbearable. Can you advise me on what to do in such a case?

Chatbot: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. Ragging is a serious issue, and there are legal provisions to address it. One of the relevant laws is the UGC Regulations on Curbing the Menace of Ragging in Higher Educational Institutions. Would you like more information on how to handle this situation under these regulations?

User: Yes, please. I'm not familiar with these regulations, and I want to understand how they can help.

Chatbot: Under these regulations, educational institutions are required to take strict action against ragging. If you're facing harassment from seniors, it's crucial to immediately report the incidents to your college authorities. They are obligated to investigate and take necessary action against the individuals involved.

User: What kind of action can the college take against those involved in ragging?

Chatbot: The actions taken by the college can range from warning and suspension to expulsion, depending on the severity of the ragging incidents. Additionally, ragging can also be a criminal offense under certain circumstances, and those found guilty may face legal consequences.

User: I see. So, it's not just a college matter but can have legal implications as well?
