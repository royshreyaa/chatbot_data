Section 85 of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act primarily addresses penalties for offenses involving the illicit transport, possession, or distribution of intoxicating liquor or prohibited substances across state borders. Penalties can include fines and imprisonment. The severity of the penalties depends on factors such as the quantity of the prohibited substances involved and any previous convictions. To navigate this situation effectively, it's essential to consult with a legal professional who can offer personalized advice.
