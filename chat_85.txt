Chatbot: Thank you for taking responsible action. In a hit-and-run case like this, the driver who fled the scene may have violated Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. This section sets out the obligations for drivers involved in accidents, particularly regarding providing information and assistance to anyone who may have been injured. Let's discuss it further.

Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act mandates that the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident must provide their name and address, the name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and the vehicle's registration mark to anyone who may have been injured or to the police. Additionally, the driver should offer necessary assistance to injured persons, such as arranging for medical aid.

In your case, noting down the license plate number of the fleeing vehicle is a crucial step. It can aid in identifying the driver who fled and ensuring that appropriate legal actions are taken.
