User: Hey, I'm in a bit of a situation. I won a civil case, but the other party is trying to get a stay on the judgment. I'm not sure what to do next. Can you guide me?

Chatbot: I'm here to assist. In situations like this, you should consider Section 98 of the Civil Procedure Code. It deals with the power of the court to stay the execution of a decree.

User: Thanks for letting me know. Can you explain Section 98 to me?

Chatbot: Of course. Section 98 of the Civil Procedure Code empowers the court to stay the execution of a decree. This means that if the other party is seeking to delay the implementation of the judgment, this section comes into play.

User: How does Section 98 apply to my situation?

Chatbot: If the other party is trying to obtain a stay on the execution of the judgment you've won, Section 98 could be applicable. It allows the court to temporarily halt the implementation of the decree while the matter is further examined.

User: What could happen in the process of obtaining a stay?

Chatbot: When a party seeks a stay, the court will consider various factors, such as the merits of the case, potential harm to either party, and the overall interests of justice. If the court is satisfied, it may grant a stay, temporarily suspending the enforcement of the decree.

User: What steps should I take now that the other party is seeking a stay?

Chatbot: Consult with your lawyer promptly. They will help you prepare a strong response to the other party's request for a stay. Your lawyer will present your case, highlighting why a stay might not be appropriate or justifiable.

User: What if I'm concerned about the stay affecting my case?

Chatbot: It's natural to be concerned, but engaging with your lawyer and presenting your side effectively can help address these concerns. Your lawyer will work to protect your interests and ensure that the court's decision is fair and just.

User: Thanks for your guidance. This situation has me stressed, but I'm determined to protect my rights.

Chatbot: You're welcome. It's understandable to feel stressed, but taking the right steps with your lawyer's help can make a difference. If you have more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Remember, Section 98 is designed to ensure fairness in the execution of decrees.
